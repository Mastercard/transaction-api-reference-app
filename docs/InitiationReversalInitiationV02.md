The ReversalInitiation message is sent by an acquirer, an originator or an agent to an issuer to request or advise of the reversal of an authorisation by the issuer. A reversal is a partial or complete nullification of the effects of a previous authorisation, financial presentment or financial accumulation presentment that cannot be processed as instructed (for example, is undeliverable and cancelled or the acquirer timed out waiting for a response).
